# 5. Predicting Academic Salaries: Can Data Science Forecast Your Paycheck?

Welcome to the forth installment of our blog series on investigating faculty salary data at a US university. In this post, we would like to discuss about Predicting Academic Salaries using Machine Learning models and analyzing our findings.

---

Imagine you're a young assistant professor. You’ve spent years earning degrees, building expertise, and finally securing a faculty position. But one question lingers in your mind: How will your salary evolve over time? 

Will experience alone guarantee a bigger paycheck? Or do promotions, administrative roles, and even your field of study play a bigger role?  

To answer these questions, I built a **machine learning model** that predicts faculty salaries. What started as a curiosity-driven project soon turned into a deep dive into **career progression, academic hierarchies, and salary disparities**.  

Here’s what I discovered.  

## **The Data: More Than Just a Paycheck**  

Salary data isn’t just numbers—it’s a reflection of **career trajectories, institutional policies, and systemic patterns** in academia.  

For this project, I used historical faculty salary data, extracting key features that could influence earnings, including:  

**Field of Study** – Salaries vary significantly across disciplines.  
**Academic Rank** – Assistant, Associate, and Full Professors follow different salary paths.  
**Years in Rank** – Promotions often come with a **salary boost**, but how long does it take?  
**Administrative Roles** – Leadership positions tend to increase earnings.  
**Year of Degree & Start Year** – Seniority matters, but how much?  
**Highest Degree Earned** – Do some degrees command higher pay?  
**Year for Salary Prediction** – Users enter a future year to see how their salary might evolve.  

Armed with these features, I set out to build a model that could **forecast salaries and uncover hidden trends** in academic pay.

## **Building the Prediction Model**  

To turn raw salary data into meaningful predictions, I chose **Lasso Regression**—a machine learning algorithm that **balances accuracy and interpretability**.  

### **Why Lasso Regression?**  
- **Feature Selection** – Lasso helps eliminate irrelevant variables, ensuring only the most important salary predictors remain.  
- **Efficiency** – It performs well even with **limited data** and avoids overfitting.  
- **Interpretability** – Unlike black-box models, Lasso allows us to **see which factors matter most** in salary prediction.  

The model was trained using historical salary records, **learning how faculty salaries change over time** based on career progression patterns.  

But what truly made this project exciting was not just forecasting paychecks—it was the **insights the model revealed**.

## **What Drives Academic Salaries? Key Insights**  

### **Gender-Based Salary Comparison** 

Does gender affect academic salaries? The model predicts **separate salaries for male and female faculty members**, highlighting **potential pay disparities**.  

While factors like rank and experience still play a major role, **the results hint at systematic differences in pay** that merit further investigation.

### **The Power of Promotions**  

How long does it take to move up the academic ladder?  

💡 According to the data, most **assistant professors are promoted after six years**—but salary growth isn’t always linear.  
💡 **Full professors** experience the largest salary jumps, reinforcing the importance of career advancement.  

This means **staying in the same rank for too long might hurt salary potential**, making promotions a crucial factor in long-term earnings.  

---

### **Administrative Roles: A Hidden Pay Boost?**

Professors who take on **administrative duties (e.g., department chairs)** tend to earn significantly more.  

Even if two faculty members have the **same years of experience**, one with an administrative role is likely to **have a higher salary trajectory**.  

So, if you’re an academic wondering whether to take on leadership responsibilities, this might be a **data-driven reason** to consider it!

## **Beyond Predictions: Visualizing Salary Trends**  

One of the most valuable aspects of this project is not just the **predictions**, but the **insights the model reveals through data visualization**.  

**Feature Importance Visualization** – Inspired by SHAP, this chart shows **which variables influence salary the most**.  
**Career Progression Simulation** – Users can enter their **own academic qualifications** to see how their salary might evolve over time.  
**Model Performance Metrics** – The R² score provides a **clear measure of prediction accuracy**.  

These visualizations help transform raw numbers into a **story of career growth and salary potential**.

## **Why This Matters**  

This project isn’t just about forecasting salaries—it’s about **empowering faculty members** to better understand their earning potential.  

**Aspiring professors** can use it to set salary expectations early in their careers.  
**Mid-career academics** can explore the impact of promotions and administrative roles.  
**Institutions** can use insights to **address salary disparities and improve policies**.  

At its core, **data science meets career strategy** in this project.

## **What’s Next?**  

While the model provides valuable salary predictions, there’s always room for improvement.  

🔍 **Future Enhancements**:  
1. Expanding the dataset to include more institutions.  
2. Adding trend analysis across multiple years.  
3. Incorporating **inflation-adjusted salaries** for better accuracy.  
4. Exploring **AI-driven career recommendations** based on salary potential.  

For now, this project stands as a **practical, data-driven tool** for academics looking to navigate their career trajectories.
