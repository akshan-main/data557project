## Overview

This project is part of the DATA 557 - Applied Stats And Exp Design course. It involves analyzing faculty salary data from a US university to investigate potential differences between male and female faculty. The dataset includes information
on faculty members employed at the university in 1995. We applied statistical methods and experimental design principles to analyze the dataset and derive meaningful insights. The project is implemented as a Streamlit web app. You can access the web app through this [link](https://data557project-salarybias.streamlit.app/) or follow the installation instructions below to run it locally.

## Project Structure

- `pages/`: Python files for all the website pages (backend and frontend).
- `blogs/`: Markdown files for blog posts.
- `data_loader.py`: Script to load data.
- `hypothesis_tests.py`: Script for all the hypothesis testing work.
- `Home.py`: Entry point for the Streamlit web app.
