st.header("Background")
st.write( """  
Salary disparities between men and women in U.S. colleges and universities have been widely studied. While discrimination based on sex is illegal, other factors may contribute to these differences, such as experience, educational qualifications, academic field, administrative roles, and productivity.\n  
Faculty salaries are influenced by multiple factors, some of which may be intertwined with gender differences. Certain disciplines command higher salaries due to market demand. Experience and promotions also play a crucial roleâ€”salaries typically increase as faculty members advance in rank. Universities enforce strict timelines for promotion from Assistant to Associate Professor, usually within six years. However, there is no set timeline for promotion from Associate to full Professor. Additionally, faculty productivity, including research grants, publications, teaching performance, and administrative responsibilities, can impact salary levels.\n  
This project aims to analyze faculty salary data to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in average salaries between male and female faculty members within an institution.
